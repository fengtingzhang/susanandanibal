Susan and An√≠bal were born more than ten thousand kilometers apart. Who could have imagined that their paths would cross on September 19, 2015. Washington Square Park, an iconic landmark in New York City, was the chosen place.

Little by little, they started to get to know each other. They discovered that there is much more than they could have ever expected during that first date, which made them wanting to spend more time together. As time passed by, their relationship grew stronger and they eventually became inseparable.

On February 21, 2019, Anibal proposed to Susan in the Alhambra palace in Granada. The Court of the Lions witnessed how Anibal kneeled and asked Susan to marry him, I guess there is no need to tell you what her response was.
