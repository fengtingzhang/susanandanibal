<h3>The city of Salamanca</h3>

The celebration will take place in Salamanca, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 due to its historical significance.

Its university, which recently celebrated its 800th anniversary, is one of the oldest universities in the world together with Oxford and Bologna. Apart from the university, there are additional landmarks like the Plaza Mayor, built in the 18th century and considered the most beautiful plaza in Spain, or the New Cathedral, built between the 16th and 18th centuries using two different styles, late Gothic and Baroque, and declared a national monument in 1887.

Despite being an old city, it has a very young and vibrant atmosphere. Every year, the university attracts thousands of students, not only from Spain, but also from around the world. There is also a great number of bars and restaurants frequented by both locals and visitors where you will have the opportunity to savor the local gastronomy, including a great selection of tapas and wine.

Salamanca is easily accessible from Madrid. If you come from abroad, there is a bus that can take you there directly from Madridâ€™s airport and takes around two and a half hours. It is also possible to get there by train, which takes only one hour and half if you take the express train.
