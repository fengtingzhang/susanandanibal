<h3>The city of Salamanca</h3>

The celebration will take place in Salamanca, a small city located in the West part of Spain, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 due to its historical significance.

Its university, which recently celebrated its 800th anniversary, is one of the oldest universities in the world that still remains active together with Oxford and Bologna. Apart from the university, there are additional landmarks like the Plaza Mayor, built in the 18th century and considered the most beautiful plaza in Spain, or the New Cathedral, built between the 16th and 18th centuries using different styles and declared a national monument in 1887.
